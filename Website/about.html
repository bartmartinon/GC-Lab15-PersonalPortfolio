			<h3>Bio</h3>
			<p>
				My name is Barthelemy Adrien Martinon, but people usually refer to me as Bart, as the real pronunciation can be a bit tricky. I was born in 1996 over in France and I have lived in the United States every since I was 6, occasionally going back to see family. While I currently reside here in Delton, MI, I used to live on the BU campus in Boston, MA for a year and a half. Back in Michigan, I actually came from Richland, MI, where I lived for about 11 years. Before Michigan, I lived over in Athens, GA for 5 years.

				Regarding my family: My parents, my cat and my dog all live in Delton. My younger brother, Thibaut, is an intellectual to finds enjoyment in learning Bio-Chemistry and political science, currently attending the University of Minnesota for his PhD. Meanwhile my youngest brother, Eliot, is more of a sports player, finding a particular amount of enjoyment in Tennis, but is hoping to pursue a career in Statistics by attending classes at the University of Wisconsin. Both my father and mother work for the VMRD division of Zoetis, a veterinarian pharmaceuticals company, at their R&D headquarters at Kalamazoo, MI. As I mentioned earlier, my entire family was born around the central and southern regions of France (with the exception of Eliot, who was born in Athens, GA.) and all of us speak fluent French, for the most part. You wouldn't be able to tell that I was French given the fact that my time in America has somewhat masked my accent when speaking English.
