HTML acts as the backbone and controller of a webpage. HTML essentially instructs the browser on how to display text and other content in a specified structure. In addition, it dictates which external files need to be pulled into the webpage, and how JavaScript and CSS files are applied. The type of content shown on the browser depends on which HTML tags are present, with tags such as <p> to show that the content is meant to be text, <div> to act as content containers, <img> to display image files, and <a> to set up clickable links. Each element has attributes that can be changed to modify their properties.

CSS controls the visuals of the webpage, hooking itself onto the HTML code of the page that pulls it in through methods such as the <link> element. CSS rules can control the colors, layout, font, sizing, and look of the website in varying levels of coverage. CSS can use selectors to either focus on setting a default look of elements via an element selector, or format specific elements denoted by the class or id attribute via the class or id selectors.
